<p>
  SSTable format uses a concept of variant integers borrowed from <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints">Protocol Buffers Base 128 Variants</a>.
  Encoding isn't exactly the same but it shares the idea that an integer does not have to be represented by a fixed number of bytes.
  In SSTables, a variant integer can be represented by 1-9 bytes and the length is encoded in the first byte.
  Important characteristic of such representation is that it uses less bytes for small numbers and more bytes for large numbers than a fixed length representation.
  Both signed and unsigned 64-bit numbers can be translated to bytes using this encoding.
  Let's investigate unsigned numbers first.

  Table below presents the number of bytes used to represent integers from different ranges.
