<p>
  SSTable format uses a concept of variant integers borrowed from [Protocol Buffers Bas 128 Variants] (https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints).
  Encoding isn't exactly the same but it shares the idea that a number does not have to be represented by a fixed number of bytes.
  In SSTables, a variant integer can be represented by 1-9 bytes.
  The length of the representation is encoded in the first byte.
