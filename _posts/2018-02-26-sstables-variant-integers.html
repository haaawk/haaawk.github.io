<p>
  SSTable format uses a concept of variant integers borrowed from <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding#varints">Protocol Buffers Base 128 Variants</a>.
  Encoding isn't exactly the same but it shares the idea that an integer does not have to be represented by a fixed number of bytes.
  In SSTables, a variant integer can be represented by 1-9 bytes.
  The length of the representation is encoded in the first byte.
