<h3><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: This post describes SSTable format mc (3.0.8, 3.9). There are multiple versions of SSTable format which can differ significantly.</b></h3>
<p>
  This file stores metadata for SSTable.
  There are 4 types of metadata:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Validation metadata</b> - used to validate SSTable correctness</li>
    <li><b>Compaction metadata</b> - used for compaction</li>
    <li><b>Statistics</b> - some information about SSTable which is loaded into memory and used for faster reads/compactions</li>
    <li><b>Serialization header</b> - keeps information about SSTable schema</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h1>General structure</h1>
<p>
  The file is composed of two parts.
  First part is a table of content which allows quick access to a selected metadata.
  Second part is a sequence of metadata stored one after the other.
</p>
<h1>Table of content</h1>
<p>
  First 4 bytes represent signed integer which is a number of metadata entries in the second part of the file.
  There are 8 bytes stored for each entry.
  First 4 bytes are a signed integer which describes the type of the metadata.
  Table below presents what types are available.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Integer representation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Validation metadata</td>
    <td align="center">0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Compaction metadata</td>
    <td align="center">1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Statistics</td>
    <td align="center">2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Serialization header</td>
    <td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
  Next 4 bytes represent an offset (signed integer) in the file at which this metadata entry starts.
