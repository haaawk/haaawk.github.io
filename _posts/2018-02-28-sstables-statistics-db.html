<h3><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: This post describes SSTable format mc (3.0.8, 3.9). There are multiple versions of SSTable format which can differ significantly.</b></h3>
<p>
  This file stores metadata for SSTable.
  There are 4 types of metadata:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Validation metadata</b> - used to validate SSTable correctness</li>
    <li><b>Compaction metadata</b> - used for compaction</li>
    <li><b>Statistics</b> - some information about SSTable which is loaded into memory and used for faster reads/compactions</li>
    <li><b>Serialization header</b> - keeps information about SSTable schema</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h1>General structure</h1>
<p>
  The file is composed of two parts.
  First part is a table of content which allows quick access to a selected metadata.
  Second part is a sequence of metadata stored one after the other.
</p>
<h1>Table of content</h1>
<p>
  First 4 bytes represent signed integer which is a number of metadata entries in the second part of the file.
  There are 8 bytes stored for each entry.
  First 4 bytes are a signed integer which describes the type of the metadata.
  Table below presents what types are available.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Integer representation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Validation metadata</td>
    <td align="center">0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Compaction metadata</td>
    <td align="center">1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Statistics</td>
    <td align="center">2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Serialization header</td>
    <td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
  Next 4 bytes represent an offset (signed integer), in the file, at which this metadata entry starts.
</p>
<h1>Validation metadata entry</h1>
<p>
  This entry starts with a UTF8 string encoded using modified UTF-8 encoding.
  You can read more about this encoding <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">HERE</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#readUTF()">HERE</a>.
  This string is a name of partitioner used to create this SSTable.
  Next 8 bytes are a double that describes the probability of false positive matches in the bloom filter for this SSTable.
</p>
<h1>Compaction metadata entry</h1>
<p>
  This entry contains a serialized <a href="https://github.com/addthis/stream-lib/blob/master/src/main/java/com/clearspring/analytics/stream/cardinality/HyperLogLogPlus.java">HyperLogLogPlus</a> which can be used to estimate the number of partition keys in the SSTable.
  If this is not present then the same estimation can be computed using Summary file.
  First 4 bytes represent a signed integer that is a length L of the serialized form of HyperLogLogPlus.
  Then there are exactly L bytes describing the HyperLogLogPlus.
</p>
<h1>Statistics entry</h1>
<p>
  This entry contains some parts of EstimatedHistogram and StreamingHistogram types.
  Let's have a look at them first.
</p>
<h2>EstimatedHistogram</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.11.1/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/utils/EstimatedHistogram.java">EstimatedHistogram</a> is starts with signed integer encoded as 4 bytes which describe number of buckets.
  Each bucket is stored in two signed longs - 8 bytes each.
  First long is the offset of the previous bucket (first bucket stores offset of itself).
  Second long is bucket's value.
  Each bucket represents values from (previous bucket offset, current offset].
  Offset for last bucket is +inf.
</p>
<h2>StreamingHistogram</h2>
<h2>Whole entry</h2>
<h1>Serialization header entry</h1>
