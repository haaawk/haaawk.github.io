<h3><b>IMPORTANT NOTE: This post describes SSTable format mc (3.0.8, 3.9). There are multiple versions of SSTable format which can differ significantly.</b></h3>
<p>
  This file stores metadata for SSTable.
  There are 4 types of metadata:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Validation metadata</b> - used to validate SSTable correctness</li>
    <li><b>Compaction metadata</b> - used for compaction</li>
    <li><b>Statistics</b> - some information about SSTable which is loaded into memory and used for faster reads/compactions</li>
    <li><b>Serialization header</b> - keeps information about SSTable schema</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h1>General structure</h1>
<p>
  The file is composed of two parts.
  First part is a table of content which allows quick access to a selected metadata.
  Second part is a sequence of metadata stored one after the other.
</p>
<h1>Table of content</h1>
<p>
  First 4 bytes represent signed integer which is a number of metadata entries in the second part of the file.
  There are 8 bytes stored for each entry.
  First 4 bytes are a signed integer which describes the type of the metadata.
  Table below presents what types are available.
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Type</th>
    <th>Integer representation</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Validation metadata</td>
    <td align="center">0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Compaction metadata</td>
    <td align="center">1</td>

    <td align="center">2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Serialization header</td>
    <td align="center">3</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
  Next 4 bytes represent an offset (signed integer), in the file, at which this metadata entry starts.
</p>
<h1>Validation metadata entry</h1>
<p>
  This entry starts with a UTF8 string encoded using modified UTF-8 encoding.
  You can read more about this encoding <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#modified-utf-8">HERE</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html#readUTF()">HERE</a>.
  This string is a name of partitioner used to create this SSTable.
  Next 8 bytes are a double that describes the probability of false positive matches in the bloom filter for this SSTable.
</p>
<h1>Compaction metadata entry</h1>
<p>
  This entry contains a serialized <a href="https://github.com/addthis/stream-lib/blob/master/src/main/java/com/clearspring/analytics/stream/cardinality/HyperLogLogPlus.java">HyperLogLogPlus</a> which can be used to estimate the number of partition keys in the SSTable.
  If this is not present then the same estimation can be computed using Summary file.
  First 4 bytes represent a signed integer that is a length L of the serialized form of HyperLogLogPlus.
  Then there are exactly L bytes describing the HyperLogLogPlus.
</p>
<h1>Statistics entry</h1>
<p>
  This entry contains some parts of EstimatedHistogram, StreamingHistogram and CommitLogPosition types.
  Let's have a look at them first.
</p>
<h2>EstimatedHistogram</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.11.1/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/utils/EstimatedHistogram.java">EstimatedHistogram</a> starts with signed integer encoded as 4 bytes which describes number of buckets.
  Each bucket is stored in two signed longs - 8 bytes each.
  First long is the offset of the previous bucket (first bucket stores offset of itself).
  Second long is bucket's value.
  Each bucket represents values from (previous bucket offset, current offset].
  Offset for last bucket is +inf.
</p>
<h2>StreamingHistogram</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.11.1/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/utils/StreamingHistogram.java">StreamingHistogram</a> starts with a signed integer encoded as 4 bytes which describes maximum number of bucktes this historgam can have.
  Another signed integer which is encoded as 4 bytes follows.
  It describes the actual number of buckets the StreamingHistogram has.
  For each bucket, there is a double and a signed long.
  Each takes 8 bytes.
  Double is an offset of the bucket and long is its value.
</p>
<h2>CommitLogPosition</h2>
<p>
  <a href="https://github.com/apache/cassandra/blob/cassandra-3.11.1/src/java/org/apache/cassandra/db/commitlog/CommitLogPosition.java">CommitLogPosition</a> consists of a signed long and signed integer.
  The long represents a segmentId while the integer is a position inside that segment.
</p>
<h2>Whole entry</h2>
<p>
  The entry starts with an EstimatedHistogram of partition sizes.
  Then it has an EstimatedHistogram of column counts.
  Next is CommitLogPosition for upper bound of commit log.
  This is followed by 2 signed longs (8 bytes each) that represent min and max timepstamp in the SSTable.
  Next are 2 signed integers (4 bytes each) that represent min and max local deletion time in the SSTable.
  Then there are two signed integers (4 bytes each) that describe min and max TTL in the SSTable.
  Next is a double (8 bytes) that stores a compression ration of the SSTable.
  This is followed by a StreamingHistogarm of tombstones in the SSTable.
  Then the entry has a signed integer (4 bytes) that stores the level of the SSTable (used probably for leveled compaction).
  Next is a signed long (8 bytes) that represents the time the SSTable was repaired.
  This is followed by min and max clustering keys.
  Each is encoded with the signed integer (4 bytes) that describes the number of key blocks and the blocks itself.
  A clustering key block is encoded using unsigned short length L (2 bytes) and L bytes that follow it.
  Then there is a boolean (1 byte) that determins whether the SSTable contains legacy counters.
  Next are total numbers of columns and rows (8 bytes signed long each).
  Version MA of SSTable 3.x format ends here and it contains only one commit log position interval - [NONE = new CommitLogPosition(-1, 0), upper bound of commit log].
  In other versions there's a CommitLogPosition here that represents lower bound of a commit log.
  Version MB of SSTable 3.x format ends here and it contains only one commit log position interval - [lower bound of commit log, upper bound of commit log].
  In other versions there's a set of commit log positions intervals serialized here.
  The set starts with a signed integer (4 bytes) that represents the number of intervals.
  Each interval is a pair of CommitLogPositions.
